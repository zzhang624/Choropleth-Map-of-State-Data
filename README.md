When the mouse hovers over a state, the tooltip should show the following information on separate lines: (1) state name, (2) region, (3) year, and (3) earthquakes in that year. 

Interactive slider uses the d3-simple-slider.min library (in the lib folder). Whit the slider, users can filter the data by year (2010 - 2015). Moving the thumb of the slider to a particular value should set year to that value and update both the choropleth map and the legend accordingly (for example, show data for 2011 when 2011 is selected on the slider).
